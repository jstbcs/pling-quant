# For many most is many but for some most is more than many

This repository contains the analysis code and manuscript of a project aimed at assessing individual difference in the use of quantifiers. The main research question is: Can we find evidence that individuals ascribe different meanings to a quantifier, even in the same (experimental) context?

Analysis code and documentation is in folder dev - please see the most recent document final_analysis.Rmd which includes the cluster analysis. The document g.html includes a lot of the model development documentation. The folder also contains the figures from the paper. The manuscript can be found in the paper folder. The data can be found in the data folder.
